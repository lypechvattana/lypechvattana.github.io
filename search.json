Although all of the departments at Institute of Technology of Cambodia(ITC) follow the same format, differences do exist. This guide is mainly based on department of Industrial and Mechanical Engineering’s requirements."

    "section": "Why you should use Latex?",
    "text": "Why you should use Latex?\nLatex is far more difficult to use than Microsoft Word, particularly for beginners. However, when writing an engineering thesis, where a slight shift in alignment by 1 point is considered a mistake, it is more convenient. Especially if the school has a pre-designed template, you don’t need much coding knowledge to use it. This guideline will explain a few commands you’ll need to know in order to complete your thesis."
