    "text": "Why you should use Latex?\nLatex is far more difficult to use than Microsoft Word, particularly for beginners. However, when writing an engineering thesis, where a slight shift in alignment by 1 point is considered a mistake, it is more convenient. Especially if the school has a pre-designed template, you don’t need much coding knowledge to use it. This guideline will explain a few commands you’ll need to know in order to complete your thesis."
